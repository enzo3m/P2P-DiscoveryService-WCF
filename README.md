# P2P-DiscoveryService-WCF
Project developed during the period from February 2015 to June 2015 for the course of Advanced Programming.

As part of this project, it was developed a peer-to-peer distributed system which let the user to search and use remote computing resources compatible with the type of processing required.

It is an educational project, designed to deepen .NET technologies (in particular the C# language, WCF and WPF), so the applications which I built make use of web services in order to communicate each other (I used WCF to this purpose), the graphical user interfaces were created using the MVVM pattern to decouple UI from the code that implements the business logic, and finally I also developed a Windows Phone app which is able to interact with the distributed application.

I plan to improve this project.
